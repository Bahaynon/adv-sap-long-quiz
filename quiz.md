## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).

   - The Service Oriented Architecture, it is a process or method of creation on a business application that operates reusable software components as services contains specific function and information differently. However, SOA is an interface for connecting each service with the single passage and individual place to make a unique collaboration business application development. It implies for structures and functions of the services in part of helping the userâ€™s needs.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.

   Standardized Service Contracts - It exposed services about the standard meaningful information that guarantee the expectation limit or policy mechanism. In a form of declaring each valueable functions and purpose as service.

   Loose Coupling - Each of elements in services are more independently and least the dependency to reduce the run time event such as weakening application in a period of time.

   Abstraction - The internal part of services architecture on processing logical operations and information. It only represent the design of relationships and encapsulates the flow of a service in terms of technical implementation from the view of users.

   Service Reusability - The services are most likely to be flexible by reusing its services as not to repeat the elements from the beginning and make a something new. This can reuse over the business process to add and update the elements and also avoids the waste of time.

   Autonomy - The services has the right own control for its logic and contained only by itself. A service must independent and not controlled by other services.

   Statelessness - Maintaining the minimal overhead state of information and should not be able to have preserved when implementing a services.

   Discoverability - In reusing a service, it is enable to be a viewable data that stores in a service to maximize its use. Including manageble, consumeble and find easily the data.

   Composability - This involves the ability of different services that combines to create a effective relationship and be a flexible structure in a business processes. Components of services are interconnected to support each other in defining the solutions with as a whole function.

   Interoperability - Services are accessible for overall control by the different software platform. Enabling the content of services communicates with other service to use in various business purpose that leads in collaboration.

3. Define Microservices.

   - The Microservices is an popular architecture based on its approach in using as a software for building single application and makes it efficiently. According to the scalability of microservices, the bigger application make up to the smaller that splits for each service aligned with the single function. Lastly, it is self based or independent operate service.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.

   Independently Deployable - The services are smaller and independent for making it easier to comprehend and test the system operates in single function. This reducing the complexity to analyze by a smaller code base.

   Right tool for the job - A microservices provides small application and appopriate tools for error isolation and continious deployment in a way of processing from the individual services.

   Precise scailing - Services are single deployed and organizations decides which service will be deployed. Lessen the chance of fragidity that might lands in software malfunction.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.

   Similarities 

     - Deployment and building applications applied in both services
     - Usage of services as software components
     - Data Duplication in SOA are rare for all applications and microservices data securing the individually complexity.

   Differences

     - SOA is enterprise wide software rather than Microservice that is use base for single application only.
     - Microservices are smaller and independent but can be deployed easily than SOA because of its code base.
     - Communication specified in SOA are mostly to have rigidity each service by Enterprise Service Bus.
     - SOA is not independently deployed but collaboratively in developing business application.
     - Microservices lessening the chance to have duplication, unlikely to the SOA operates slowly base on speed.

6. Define Web Services.

    - A web services is the system wherein devices can be connected to each other within the server. At this point, software application communicates to pass the data from one another to other system through the use of internet or communication network.

7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.

    Exposing the existing function on the network - In the used of https, this can be managed the code into the service over the network when it exposed and other application can use it eventually of the program provided in the service.

    Interoperability - A service that is independent language of making a closure to the other applications for transmitting a data or programs on behalf of service function.

    Standardized Protocol - It is a default or base service protocol over internet as the main source of communication on other applications to communicate on various programs.

    Low Cost Communication - This service applies short transmission via small or medium internet to provide a quality services among the communication network.

8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.

    XML Based - Web service used XML for allowing the various platforms to transport and reception of data in a programs with the different languages. This associates the common exchanging of information including the programs and databases.

    Loosely coupled - A service does not bound in between clients and web service because of the independently server that has, even the service was changed. It will not affect the clients service and has the different interfaces.

    Coarsed-Grained - Service as a volume of business beyond the specific manner of data indvidiually by the method in defining the data will be consume in period of time.

    Ability to be Synchronous or Asynchronous - The clients are defined to interact and operate with the web service to be accomplished or patiently stand by before to proceed. Otherwise, Asynchronous is in time operation that invokes a service and execute functions in parallel.

    Supports Remote Procedure Calls - A service that provides a self service for a clients by implementing functions and procedures in the use of XML based protocol.

    Supports Document Exchange - A web service enable the enterprise to have a communication on exchanging the documents to make it as a whole collaboration. Not a simply type of data can be pass in the use of service but als document of information about the business environment.

9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.

   Provider - A role that is responsible for publishing and contributing in making an interface for web service on a client application.

   Requestor - A role that is responsible for requesting a service by the clients whose need to access a web service. Also, it passes information of web service upto registry process.

   Broker - A role that is responsible for searching a web service base on client requests.

10. List and discuss the Web Services Components.

   SOAP - It stands for Simple Object Access Protocol or a structured messaging protocol that has ability to exchange data on other applications by means of communication.

   WSDL - It stands for Web Services Description Language that has a procedural terms of indentifying a processes on accessing a web services. Providing an internal information of web service to conduct an individual purpose.

   UDDI - It stands for Universal Description, Discovery and Integration, this component is part of the roles in web services which is used by the provider, requestor, and broker to control the service in terms of publishing and searching a service for the client application.
